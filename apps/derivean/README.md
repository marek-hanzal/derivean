# Project Blackfox

This is a new implementation of CZ Marsh Backoffice, originating from Motor Fleet.

## Notes

This app uses quite a bunch of tools:

- `next.js` as a general framework
- `antd` as UI library, slowly being replaced by Mantine UI library
- `turborepo` for monorepo management
- individual packages for every piece of the app to strictly separate application concerns
- `esbuild` in libraries
- `eslint` for catching `shits-in-the-code`
- and other stuff I'm lazy to write now here
